// Port of the thinking-budget cap + partial-trace reuse logic from
// providers.py. little-coder's Python implementation aborts the stream
// mid-flight when thinking tokens cross the budget, re-injects the partial
// trace as assistant context, and retries with thinking disabled. Pi's
// AgentSession doesn't expose mid-stream abort-and-replace, so we approximate
// it: count thinking tokens, and on breach disable thinking + queue a
// commit-to-an-implementation nudge, then abort the over-long turn.
//
// ── Issue #8, second reproduction (1.4.3) ───────────────────────────────────
// The v1.0.0 fix deferred the recovery (`setThinkingLevel("off")` +
// `sendUserMessage`) to a `turn_end` handler, after a `setImmediate` yield, and
// ran it against the module-scope `pi`. But `ctx.abort()` makes pi's `agent_end`
// run auto-retry / auto-compaction (both enabled in .pi/settings.json), which
// REPLACES the session (dispose() → ExtensionRunner.invalidate()). The
// setImmediate yield is exactly what let that replacement land *before* the
// deferred recovery, so the recovery touched a now-stale `pi` and threw
// ("This extension ctx is stale after session replacement or reload"). Net
// effect: thinking was never turned off (the next step kept thinking) and the
// follow-up never reached the model (the agent appeared to stop) — the #8
// symptom, on a different mechanism than the original.
//
// Fix: do the whole recovery SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `message_update`, BEFORE
// `ctx.abort()`, while `pi` is still live and the session hasn't been replaced.
// No `turn_end` handler, no `setImmediate` — nothing runs against a stale ref.
//
//   1. Count thinking_delta tokens during message_update.
//   2. On breach: capture the current thinking level, flip thinking to "off",
//      queue the commit nudge as a follow-up, surface one harness-intervention
//      line, THEN ctx.abort().
//   3. Keep thinking off across the restart turn(s): `forcedOff` re-asserts
//      "off" on every turn_start until the user submits a genuinely new prompt
//      (`input` event), at which point the prior level is restored so the next
//      task can think again. (A new task should not inherit "off" just because
//      a previous one over-thought.)
